HealthCare Insurance_Cross Sells Prediction

Our client is an insurance company that has provided health insurance to its customers. 
Now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders from the past year will also be interested in vehicle insurance provided by the company.

Insurance policies are arrangements where a company guarantees compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in exchange for the payment of a premium. 
Customers pay a regular premium to the insurance company for this guarantee. Similarly to medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where customers pay a premium each year to the insurance provider. 
In the event of an unfortunate accident involving the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide compensation, known as the "sum assured," to the customer.

Creating a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in vehicle insurance is extremely helpful for the company.
It allows them to plan their communication strategy accordingly, reaching out to those customers and optimizing their business model and revenue. 
They have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), vehicles (vehicle age, damage), and policy details (premium, sourcing channel), among other factors.
